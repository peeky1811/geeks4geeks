Here, I add my solutions to questions from geeks for geeks. 

I am preparing for my interviews, so I am doing questions I find on geeks for geeks.
I am keeping a copy of my solutions for my reference. Otherwise I don't like to post my code on github.
But if my style of solution helps anybody, feel free to look at it. That's why I've made it public.
